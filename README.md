# Agentic Workflows with Python

This repository showcases various implementations of agentic AI workflows using pure Python. These workflows demonstrate how autonomous agents can perform specific tasks without relying on external frameworks, providing a clear and lightweight approach to understanding their operations.

## Overview

- **Autonomous Agents**: Implementations of agents that independently execute tasks.
- **Pure Python**: No external AI frameworks required.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extend and customize workflows.

## Reference

The implementations in this repository were inspired by concepts discussed in the following article:
